<p>I have 16+ years of experience in improving individual lives by applying Ayurvedic medicinal knowledge and modern nutrition. I provide consultation for lifestyle related problems and herbal remedies. </p>

<p>Diet and lifestyle are major factors thought to influence susceptibility to many diseases, and by right dietary and herbal regime many diseases can be prevented. As per Ayurveda, every individual has a unique body constitution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prak%E1%B9%9Bti"><i>prakriti</i></a>, and everyone needs a unique diet plans to stay healthy with complex modern lifestyle. According to WHO, 60% of related factors to individual health and quality of life are correlated to lifestyle <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15468523/">[pubmed]</a>. </p>

<p>Instead of counting your calories, your diet will be designed to correct the body imbalances (<i>vikrut doshas</i>) by harmonizing the inherent nature of the food you consume to the constitution of your body. If these imbalances are not rectified today, they may manifest as future diseases. Since each individual has a different constitution, the diet & herbal recommendations are tailored for each individual resulting in a truly personalized prescription. You are not only prescribed but encouraged to learn and take ownership of what you eat; its not temporary but a lifetime lesson. </p>

<p><b>I am an Ayurvedic doctor graduated from Delhi University</b>, and hold a Diploma in Naturopathy and Diploma in Yoga (N.D.D.Y). I also have an <b>M.B.A in Healthcare Management</b>. I have rich experience in dealing with people from all walks of life and various age groups. I am keen to help you to provide you the right direction for a healthy innings. </p>
